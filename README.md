DeepViolet
==========

Java GUI tool for introspection of SSL\TLS sessions.  Inspired by work by Qualys SSL Labs and Ivan RistiÄ‡.  I have also tried to include some attribution where it's deserved at least in the code comments for now.  Original blog article post describing this project, http://www.securitycurmudgeon.com/2014/07/ssltls-introspection.html

This program is provided for educational purposes.  Use at your own risk.  This program is only available in US English.

INSTALL AND RUN

1) Git the code

2) Edit logging properties in logback.xml as desired.  Currently a debug file is created in /Users/milton/DeepViolet/DeepVioletLog.txt.  You will want to update for your system with an appropriate fully qualified file name.  This file contains diagnostic output, program errors, exceptional conditions, etc.

3) Report folder.  This output is identical to the output printed to the screen and is useful to when referring to previous runs.  When the tool is run it writes a copy of the completed report to,
~/DeepViolet/ (Mac OS X & *NIX )
C:\My Documents\DeepViolet\ (Windows, not tested)
Reports files are written in the following format,
DeepViolet-<host>-yyyy-mm-dd-hr-mm-sec-tz.txt  

4) Permissions.  Make sure the account assigned to process has full privileges to the previously mentioned directories.
